This project is to predict Grade 2+ acute rectum toxicity caused by intesity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer patients. 

Data: Patient-specific variables, Hormone therapy, etc.
Dose map on each organ during treatment planning. At first 79 patients. To validate the model accuracy, we add another 15 patients.

Model: Integrate biological model (LKB) model and statistical model and maintain certain good properties during the estimation to reduce the bias of the estimation

Outcome: Achieve the best accuracy compared with existing methods. Details please see paper
